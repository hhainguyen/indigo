![Top 100 UK Surnames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hhainguyen/indigo/gh-pages/assets/top100-uknames.png)

**Names** is one of my most favourite projects. We looked at how to represent information for a name and how such representation can be used to gain more understanding of a user like what is the country of origin, ethnicity, or gender... I have built a few models to classify forenames, surnames and full names into different typologies, mainly country of origin.
